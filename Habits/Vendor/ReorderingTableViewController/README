ATSDragToReorderTableViewController is a UITableViewController subclass that adds drag and drop reordering to a UITableView. 

I developed it as part of Acacia Tree Software’s SousChef for iPhone and it has since become an integral part of Ita for sister company Nice Mohawk. This is definitely a eating-our-own-dogfood piece of code.

A UITableView with this functionality can be reordered without switching into edit mode. It’s simply a press and hold to start, then drag the cell to reorder. The UITableView automatically scrolls when approaching the top or bottom of the UITableView.

=====

It is straightforward to incorporate into your app. 

	1.  Instead of subclassing from UITableViewController, you subclass from ATSDragToReorderTableViewController. 

	2.  Then implement the UITableViewDataSource method -tableView:moveRowAtIndexPath:toIndexPath: . You might have already done this.

	3.	If you want to better support iOS <redacted>, you'll want to check out -cellIdenticalToCellAtIndexPath:forDragTableViewController: I am very annoyed about this.

The included sample app includes these changes as a demonstration. Further details are described at the top of the ATSDragToReorderTableViewController.h .

For those curious, ATSDragToReorderTableViewController.m includes a fairly comprehensive overview of the implementation at the top and is ridiculously over-commented throughout.

=====

ATSDragToReorderTableViewController relies on UIGestureRecognizer and uses block-based animations throughout. It now has full support for ARC and I'm too lazy to continue to support non-ARC projects so this will be iOS 5+ only from now on.

Licensing info is at the very top of the files as well as in a file called LICENSE.

I am trying to be reserved here but I am pretty excited about this and hope you find this exciting too.
